 Netflix Data Analytics
This project analyzes Netflix’s content dataset using Excel, Power BI, NumPy, and Pandas to uncover insights about movies and TV shows available on the platform. The goal is to explore trends, genres, ratings, and release patterns to better understand Netflix’s content strategy.

🔍 Project Overview
The project follows a complete data analytics lifecycle:

Data Collection – Netflix dataset in CSV format.

Data Cleaning & Preparation – Handled missing values, removed duplicates, standardized formats using Pandas & NumPy.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Performed in Python to identify patterns in content distribution, ratings, and countries.

Data Visualization – Created interactive dashboards in Power BI and summary reports in Excel.

Insights & Findings – Key takeaways from the analysis are documented.

🛠 Tech Stack & Tools
Excel – Data cleaning, pivot tables, and initial exploration.

Power BI – Interactive dashboards and KPI visualization.

Python Libraries:

Pandas – Data manipulation & preprocessing.

NumPy – Numerical computations.
